    <h2>Day 56 solution</h2>
    <p>
      So Day 56 was all about using csv reading and file and folder
      manipulation<br />
      to make 100 files in dozens of folders. This was tricky because the
      names<br />
      of the folders and files were based on the top 100 streaming songs and
      so<br />
      weren't simple to encode.

    <h2>Day 26 solution</h2>
    <p>
      Day 26 was about using the playsound module to play songs. I had<br />
      difficulties because I was using a newer version of the playsound
      module<br />
      but I had to downgrade to a lower version to get it to work. To figure<br />
      that out required a lot of hardwork and time of research but alas, I<br />
      solved it!

    <h2>Day 43 solution</h2>
    <p>
      Day 43 was about bingo. I was able to get a solution that was similar<br />
      to the one on the website and I felt very proud of myself.

    <h2>Day 62 solution</h2>
    <p>
      Day 62 was about using the replit DB to create a secret diary. On the<br />
      replit interface, this might have been very easy. I decided to try
      using<br />
      files to do it to challenge myself and it was difficult but it was an<br />
      amazing time coding. I felt very proud of myself for being able to<br />
      accomplish it!

    <h2>A Random Replit Day</h2>
    <p>
      This was a day when a friend of mine texted me on Twitter and told me
      that<br />
      he was also actively taking the Replit 100 Days of Code course and I
      felt<br />
      very happy to be an encouragement to someone to keep pushing and come
      out<br />
      strong!
